# Preflight

> Pre-flight a dependency **before** you add or auto-update it — known CVEs, health, and whether
> it's actually safe to bump given your framework.

Most tools (Dependabot, Snyk, Socket) analyze the dependencies you *already have*. Preflight
answers the question that bites you *earlier*: **"is this safe to add, and safe to auto-update?"**
Its edge is a **framework-lockstep registry** — it knows that Expo, Angular, Nx, Next.js, Nuxt,
SvelteKit, Remix, and Astro each pin a coordinated set of packages, so it tells you to bump those
via the framework's own tool (`npx expo install`, `npx nuxi upgrade`, …) instead of letting a
per-package updater break your build.

## Highlights
- **Supply-chain pre-flight engine** — parses npm/pip manifests, batches queries to the OSV
  vulnerability database, and classifies each dependency as `safe` / `pinned` / `cve` / `stale`.
  Keyless, deterministic, and cached on disk (24h) to respect rate limits.
- **Framework-lockstep detection** — a data-driven registry that flags packages a framework pins
  as a set (Expo, Angular, Nx, Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit, Remix, Astro), the failure mode generic
  auto-updaters (Dependabot/Renovate) can't see — with the exact upgrade command to use instead.
- **Severity + health enrichment** — maps GHSA labels and computes CVSS v3 base scores for
  advisories that ship only a vector; `--health` adds each dep's OpenSSF Scorecard from deps.dev.
- **Beyond known CVEs** — flags packages that run **install scripts** (npm's #1 supply-chain
  vector), names that look like **typosquats** of popular packages (fully offline), risky/unknown
  **licenses**, and weak **OpenSSF Scorecard** checks — catching risk that has no CVE yet.
- **Runtime-compatibility check** — declare the runtime the project actually runs on
  (`--python 3.9` / `--node 18`, a `runtimes` key in the config, or auto-detected from
  `.python-version`/`.nvmrc`) and Preflight flags dependencies whose range **cannot install
  there** (`incompatible`), plus an early warning when the *newest* release dropped your runtime —
  i.e. the next auto-bump will break. Catches the class of failure CI on a newer interpreter
  can't: a floor like `uvicorn>=0.49` is green on Python 3.12 but uninstallable on the 3.9 dev
  machine (`Requires-Python >=3.10`). Data: PyPI `Requires-Python` (hard install failure) and
  npm `engines` (advisory), per version.
- **CI-gating** — exits non-zero on any CVE, so it drops straight into a pipeline.
- **Three delivery surfaces, one engine** — a CLI (built to a standalone bundle with tsup), a
  GitHub Action that gates PRs, and a web dashboard, all reusing `@preflight/core`.

## Stages
1. **CLI** (`@preflight/cli`) — `preflight check <manifest>` → a verdict table (`safe` / `pinned` /
   `cve` / `incompatible` / `stale`), with `--latest` (latest version + staleness), `--health`
   (OpenSSF Scorecard), `--node <v>` / `--python <v>` (runtime-compatibility), `--json`, and
   `--no-cache`. **Working today.**
2. **GitHub Action** (`@preflight/action`) — on every PR, diffs the *whole dependency tree*
   (manifest + lockfile, so lockfile-only PRs count) and posts a sticky comment; the gate fails
   on anything the PR **introduces** — direct or transitive — that meets `fail-level` or violates
   the policy. Pre-existing findings stay informational (the scheduled repo scan owns those).
   **Working today** ([.github/workflows/preflight.yml](.github/workflows/preflight.yml)).
3. **Web dashboard** (`@preflight/web`, Next.js App Router) — paste a manifest → metric cards +
   findings list matching [docs/dashboard-mockup.html](docs/dashboard-mockup.html), dark-mode aware.
   **Live at [preflight-web.vercel.app](https://preflight-web.vercel.app)**. Also exposes a keyless
   `POST /api/scan` (send a manifest + lockfile → full report) so other apps can embed it —
   see [docs/integration.md](docs/integration.md). GitHub-repo OAuth is deferred.

## Quickstart
```bash
npm install
npm run check -- path/to/package.json      # or a requirements*.txt
npm run check -- examples/requirements.txt --latest   # add latest-version + staleness
npm test                                    # vitest
npm run build                               # tsup → standalone dist (publishable CLI)
npm run dev -w @preflight/web               # the dashboard at http://localhost:3000
npm run scan:repos                          # read-only sweep of all your GitHub repos (needs `gh`)
```

`scan:repos` lists your repos via `gh`, pulls each manifest, and prints a ranked cross-repo report —
it writes nothing to any repo. To gate repos going forward, see [docs/rollout.md](docs/rollout.md).

Example (an Expo app — everything Expo-pinned, nothing to auto-bump):
```
17 deps · 0 CVE · 10 pinned · 0 stale · 7 safe
 PINNED  react-native@0.85.3   Framework-pinned (Expo) — update via npx expo install
 SAFE    typescript@6.0.3      Independent — safe to auto-update (CI-gated)
```

Example (a pip manifest with old pins — CI would fail on these):
```
5 deps · 4 CVE · 0 pinned · 0 stale · 1 safe
 CVE     pyyaml@5.3.1 · latest 6.0.3    2 advisory · critical
 CVE     jinja2@2.10  · latest 3.1.6    8 advisory · high
 SAFE    rich@13.7.1  · latest 15.0.0   Independent — safe to auto-update (CI-gated)
```

## Design-phase mode: `preflight plan`

The checks above catch problems in an *existing* manifest. `preflight plan` moves them to the
**start of a project** — pick the runtime the app will actually run on (and optionally a
framework), list the packages you intend to use, and get the newest versions that install
there plus the generated guardrails:

```bash
npm run plan -- --python 3.9 fastapi uvicorn httpx --dev pytest
npm run plan -- --node 18 --framework expo axios
npm run plan -- --python 3.9 fastapi --write my-app   # write the files
```

```
uvicorn@0.39.0 (latest 0.49.0 incompatible)
    0.40.0+ requires Python >=3.10 — capped

── requirements.txt ──
uvicorn>=0.39.0,<0.40    # 0.40.0+ requires Python >=3.10 — capped

── .github/dependabot.yml ──
    ignore:
      # These ranges dropped Python 3.9 — don't bump past them.
      - dependency-name: uvicorn
        versions: ['>=0.40']
```

It emits the manifest (`requirements.txt` / `package.json` with an `engines` field) and a
`dependabot.yml` with grouped weekly updates, an `ignore` at each runtime boundary, and — with
`--framework` — the whole lockstep set ignored ("update with `npx expo install`, not
per-package bumps"). Recommended versions are OSV-checked, so a floor that would pin onto a
known CVE is flagged in the plan.

## How it works
`@preflight/core` is the single engine: `manifest` → `osv` + `lockstep` (+ `registry`/`depsdev`)
→ `verdict` → `Report`. The CLI, Action, and dashboard are thin wrappers over `analyze()`.
See [docs/spec.md](docs/spec.md) for the verdict logic and API details, and
[docs/preflight-checklist.md](docs/preflight-checklist.md) for the broader dependency-hygiene
practices this tool automates.

## Policy gate

By default `preflight check` (and the Action) fail on any new CVE. For finer control, drop a
`preflight.config.json` and pass `--policy` (CLI) or set `policy-file:` (Action) — the same gate,
evaluated by `@preflight/core`:

```json
{
  "runtimes": { "python": "3.9" },
  "failOn": {
    "vuln": "kev",
    "installScript": true,
    "suspiciousName": true,
    "license": ["copyleft"],
    "minHealth": 5,
    "runtime": "incompatible"
  },
  "allow": ["esbuild", "sharp@0.34.5", "GHSA-qx2v-qp2m-jg93"]
}
```

- `vuln` — `"cve"` (any), `"kev"` (confirmed-exploited only), or `"epss:0.5"` (exploit probability ≥ x).
- `installScript` / `suspiciousName` — fail on a dep that runs an install script / has a typosquat-like name.
- `license` — fail on these license ids, or the buckets `"copyleft"` / `"unknown"`.
- `minHealth` — fail if a *direct* dep's OpenSSF score is below this.
- `runtime` — `"incompatible"` fails when a dep's range cannot install on the target runtime
  (declared in `runtimes` or via flags); `"latest-dropped"` also fails the early warning (the
  newest release dropped the runtime, so the next bump breaks). Without a policy, an explicit
  `--node`/`--python` target failing to install exits non-zero; auto-detected targets
  (`.nvmrc`/`.python-version`) only warn.
- `allow` — adjudicated exemptions, so a strict rule stays on for everything else instead of the
  gate being red forever on findings nobody can act on (legitimate native-binary install scripts,
  a CVE vendored by the framework). Entries: a package name (`"esbuild"`, any version), an exact
  pin (`"sharp@0.34.5"` — stops applying on the next bump), or an advisory id (`"GHSA-…"`/`"CVE-…"`).
  Suppressions are always counted in the output — an exemption is visible, never silent.

Malicious packages always fail, regardless of config — and the `allow` list cannot exempt them.
`--policy` auto-enables the lookups its rules need (`license` → latest version, `minHealth` →
health), so you don't have to remember the flags.

## Keyless to run

Every data source Preflight queries is **free, keyless, and accountless** — nothing to sign up for,
no API key to store, no token to rotate. That's what lets it drop straight into any pipeline (local,
CI, or the dashboard) with zero configuration.

| Source | What Preflight gets from it | Endpoint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **OSV.dev** | Known vulnerabilities + malicious-package (`MAL-`) advisories → the `cve` / `malware` verdicts + severity | `api.osv.dev` |
| **FIRST EPSS** | Exploit *probability* (0–1) per CVE — rank what's likely to actually be attacked | `api.first.org/data/v1/epss` |
| **CISA KEV** | CVEs *confirmed* exploited in the wild — the "patch this now" list | `cisa.gov/.../known_exploited_vulnerabilities.json` |
| **deps.dev** (v3) | OpenSSF Scorecard (project security health), behind `--health` | `api.deps.dev/v3` |
| **npm registry** | Latest version + last-publish date → the `stale` verdict + version transitions | `registry.npmjs.org` |
| **PyPI** (JSON) | Latest version + upload time, for pip manifests | `pypi.org/pypi/{name}/json` |

Every response is cached on disk for 24h (`.preflight-cache/`) to be a good API citizen and make
re-runs instant.

> **Design principle:** every new check must be *quick, keyless, and accountless*. If a data source
> needs an account or an API key, it doesn't belong here — that constraint is the whole point, and
> it's what keeps Preflight a drop-in.

## Experience Gained
- Designed a keyless supply-chain analysis **engine** (TypeScript, ESM npm-workspaces monorepo) over
  the OSV, deps.dev, npm, and PyPI APIs — batched queries, a 24h on-disk cache, and a CVSS v3
  base-score calculator — shipped as a standalone **CLI** bundled with tsup.
- Built a **CI/CD security gate** as a GitHub Action (`@actions/*` toolkit + Octokit) that diffs
  dependency changes on each pull request, posts an automated review comment, and fails the check on
  a newly-introduced CVE — self-tested by running on its own PRs.
- Shipped a **Next.js (App Router, React 19) dashboard** that analyzes a pasted manifest through a
  Node route handler and renders a dark-mode-aware metric/findings view — one engine reused across a
  CLI, a CI action, and a web app via a TypeScript workspace (`transpilePackages`).
- Modeled framework **lockstep** version sets (Expo, Angular, Nx, Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit, Remix,
  Astro) to produce upgrade guidance generic auto-updaters can't, and verified every external API
  shape against live docs before coding.
- Deepened it into a real supply-chain scanner: **whole-lockfile transitive** scanning, **risk-based
  prioritization** (EPSS exploit-probability + CISA KEV) over CVSS, **malicious-package** detection,
  **CycloneDX SBOM** + **SARIF** (GitHub Security tab) export, and a **scheduled cron re-scan** that
  files an issue when a dependency becomes newly vulnerable — all keyless.
- Added proactive, pre-CVE supply-chain signals: **install-script** detection, an **offline typosquat
  heuristic** (Damerau-Levenshtein vs a bundled popular-package list), **license-risk** bucketing, and
  an **OpenSSF Scorecard** per-check breakdown — the risk a vulnerability feed can't tell you about.
- Unified every signal into a configurable **policy-as-code gate** (`preflight.config.json`) shared by
  the CLI and the Action — one source of truth for what fails the build (denied license, install
  script, typosquat, min-health floor, or a tunable CVE/KEV/EPSS threshold).
